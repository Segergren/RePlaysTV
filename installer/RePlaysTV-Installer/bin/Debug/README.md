# RePlaysTV-Installer/Debug
Before debug, make sure you have the 4 necessary folders:

- app
- Git
- src
- src-patch

You can get the `Git` folder from an already packaged release.  Simlarly, you can do the same with `app`. However, release may not up to date with this branch. To be safe, install the following npm packages using the nodejs portable executable:

- 7z
- asar
- electron-forge
- forge

This will create the `app` folder with the necessary packages.

`src` and `src-patch` can be manually copied over from root folder.

## TO-DO
Edit this readme to be more indepth.
